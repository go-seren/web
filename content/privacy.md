# PRIVACY POLICY

Effective Date: 28/05/2023

Welcome to Seren, your personal journaling oasis (the "App"). We are a sanctuary for your thoughts, dedicated to preserving your privacy with utmost respect and care. We collect only the bare minimum information necessary to facilitate your use of our services, all while ensuring top-tier protection for your data. This Privacy Policy delineates the nature of the data we gather, its applications, and our unwavering commitment to safeguarding your information.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

### A. User-Provided Information

We promote a user-first approach, meaning that we limit our data collection to only what is crucial for your seamless experience. This includes:

- **Account Information:** Our collection extends only to your email address during the creation of your account. We use this exclusively for logging you into the App, employing hash technology to fully mask your email for everyone except you.

- **Content:** Your thoughts are safe with us. We securely store the entries and chat messages you create within the App, keeping them encrypted both in transit and at rest.

### B. Automated Information

We do not engage in automated collection of personal data like IP addresses or device information. Instead, our focus lies on gathering usage statistics such as frequency of use and features employed within the App, to consistently refine and optimize its functionality.

## 2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We utilize the gathered information to:

- **Enhance Your App Experience:** We leverage data to tailor the App to your preferences, with a continuous commitment to improving your user experience.

- **Optimize Your Journal Entries:** We process your anonymized or pseudonymized journal entries using the OpenAI API, resulting in an enhanced, personalized journaling experience.

## 3. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

Your privacy is our sanctuary, and we share your information only under these specific circumstances:

- **With OpenAI API:** To enrich your journaling journey, we share your anonymized or pseudonymized journal entries with OpenAI API. As per OpenAI's Privacy Policy, they do not use data submitted via their API to train or enhance their models unless explicitly granted permission. OpenAI retains API data for a 30-day period to monitor misuse, post which it is deleted, barring any legal requirements. You can read more about it here: [OpenAI Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)

- **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your hashed email address if necessitated by law, or if such action is crucial to comply with legal obligations or respond to legal proceedings.

## 4. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Safeguarding your information is our prime duty. We utilize rigorous security measures including SSL encryption for data in transit, anonymization or pseudonymization where applicable, and stringent access controls for our database. Rest assured, your data is resilient to attacks and remains unreadable even to us, fostering a secure journaling space.

## 5. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

As we continue evolving, so may this Privacy Policy. Should any significant changes occur, we will ensure to notify you through the App, update the "Effective Date" at the top, and post the revised policy here.
